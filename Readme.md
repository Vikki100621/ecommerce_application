Tools, using in project development:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/);

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/);

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/);

## How to develop, use, and test the code

For using project on Your machine:
- clone this project to your machine using git:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Vikki100621/ecommerce_application
  ```

- install packets using npm

  ```

Project files are in `src` directory. Main branch is `develop`. If You want to add some feature, create new branch from `main` and code. After You end adding the functional, create pull request for merging your code to `develop` branch, but **don't merge it** before all reviewers approve.

## Scripts for development

For better coding we add some scripts.

When You develop, you can use script

```
npm run serve
```

This will start dev-server and open browser with running project. Every time You save the code will reload opened page in browser.

Also you can build project in two ways:

1. Development mode:

    ```
    npm run build:dev
    ```

2. Production mode:

    ```
    npm run build:prod
    ```

When You build the application, it will be built in `distr` catalog.

For linting use

```
npm run lint
```

You will see all the code, needed to be changed.

Prettier can be started by command 

```
npm run pret
```

Anyway, eslint and prettier will be started every time You'll make the commit.

Jest You can use in two ways:

1. For only test your code:

    ```
    npm run test
    ```

2. For getting information about test coverage all over the project code:

    ```
    npm run test-cover
